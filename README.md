# BurgerBar_Assignment

# INTRODUCTION
This is a burger application where users can add a slice in a
burger and every slice has some price and calculate total
burger price. Users can order multiple burgers.
User can Increase/Decrease slices inside the burger (e.g. aloo Tikki, Paneer, Cheese etc)
Create burger visual images using ReactJS
Add slice of burger and calculate total price of burger
Add Quantity tab, user can order multiple burgers
Burger should look like the image below and use different colours for different slice
Prepare and integrate a NodeJS API to store the order information in mongodb atlas free tire database with customer mobile number, and generate an order number with a prefix and serial number e.g. BURG-007
Display the next order number on the cart form.
Code should be of good standard, make a single solution where the reactJS solution should be inside the nodeJS solution and the entire app should run on npm start command.
